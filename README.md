# Mod_5_Project

_Work by Song Ying and Antoine Ghilissen_

__Executive Summary__: Analyzing Major League Baseball (MLB) World Series statistics (1946-2016) to formulate in-game strategies for maximal chance of winning a match.

Using the dataset compiled by Retrosheet, we achieved the following:
1. Data Exploration
2. Performed Data Cleaning & Feature Engineering
2. Baseline Model via Logistic Regression 
3. Decision Tree
4. Random Forest
5. XGBoost
6. 

__Data Source__: MLB Game Logs (1871-2016) sourced from Retrosheet. Dataset can be found here: https://data.world/dataquest/mlb-game-logs

__Methodology__: This project uses Python 3, documented with Jupyter Notebook. We used a combination of Numpy and Pandas for data cleaning, filtering and feature engineering. __Add methodology !__

__High Level Overview__:

__Files__:
- <code>index.ipynb</code> : main Jupyter Notebook
- <code>MLB-GameLogs-1871_2016.csv</code> : Original Dataset csv

__Limitations__:
1. Data samples from 1970-1979 and 1990-1999 were missing and therefore not included in our analysis.
2. 

__Future Work__:
1. In-depth analysis of linescore paired with match statistics per innings of the game from other sources to investigate probability of winning the match as the match progresses.
2. 

__Actionable Insights__:
1.
